## Introduction

Methods is a powerful framework that enables developers to build high-performance and scalable web applications. It leverages popular technologies such as NestJS, GraphQL, and Mongoose to create flexible and modular applications.

## Getting Started

To get started with Methods, you'll need to ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

1. **Node.js**: Methods requires Node.js version 18.x or higher. If you don't have Node.js installed, you can download the latest version from the official website: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

   Alternatively, if you prefer to manage multiple Node.js versions, you can use NVM (Node Version Manager). You can find installation instructions for NVM on its GitHub repository: [NVM GitHub Repository](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

2. **npm**: npm (Node Package Manager) comes bundled with Node.js, so once you have Node.js installed, you'll also have npm available.

Follow these steps to set up the Methods application:

3. Install the application and its dependencies using npm. Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project's root directory, and run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```


## Main Libraries

Methods is built using several powerful libraries and frameworks. Here are the main ones used in this project:

1. **NestJS**: NestJS is the framework used to build the web application. It provides a solid foundation for developing scalable and maintainable Node.js applications. You can find more about NestJS on their official website: [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)

2. **Mongoose**: Mongoose is used as the Object-Document Mapper (ODM) for MongoDB in Methods. It provides a straightforward and schema-based solution to model application data. To learn more about Mongoose, check their official documentation: [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)

3. **Jest**: Jest is the testing framework used in Methods. It provides a simple and powerful way to test the application's code. You can find more information about Jest on their official website: [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)

With these libraries and frameworks, Methods offers a robust and efficient foundation for building your web applications. Happy coding!
